Dear Madam or Sir,
</p>

<p>
With this experiment, we aim to study peoples’ investment decisions. Therefore, in this experiment, you will be asked to make investment decisions. You will be presented various investment decisions, and we ask you to make your decisions as you would in real life. 
</p>

<p>
You will be paid for your participation. Your reward will depend on your investment decisions and chance. The average payoff will be USD 2. We will provide more details on the investment task and your payment on the next pages. 
</p>

<p>
In addition to the investment decisions, we will ask some rather general questions on your background. We kindly ask you to answer all questions truthfully. 
</p>

<p>
In the experiment, you can only navigate using the “Next” button. You cannot navigate with your browser and you cannot go back to a previous page. If you do not want to continue, you can close the browser window at any time.   
</p>

<p>
    On average, we expect to take less than 10 minutes of your time to complete the experiment. 
</p>

<p>
